## How to install

For MacOS, Linux, and Windows running WSL, you can install the NPL CLI using

```shell
curl -s https://documentation.noumenadigital.com/get-npl-cli.sh | bash
```

or download the latest release [here](https://github.com/NoumenaDigital/npl-cli/releases) and add it to your $PATH. On
Windows running WSL, you will need to manually add the `npl` executable to your PATH. The script above will not do that
for you.

For Windows without WSL, you may download the latest `.exe` executable
[here](https://github.com/NoumenaDigital/npl-cli/releases)
