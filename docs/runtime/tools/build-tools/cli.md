# NPL CLI

offers several useful commands for interacting with your NPL projects.

## How to install

For MacOS, Linux, and Windows running WSL, you can install the NPL CLI using

```shell
curl -s https://documentation.noumenadigital.com/get-npl-cli.sh | bash
```

or download the latest release [here](https://github.com/NoumenaDigital/npl-cli/releases) and add it to your $PATH. On
Windows running WSL, you will need to manually add the `npl` executable to your PATH. The script above will not do that
for you.

For Windows without WSL, you may download the latest `.exe` executable
[here](https://github.com/NoumenaDigital/npl-cli/releases)

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

Once you've installed the CLI, you can use it in MCP mode with your local AI tools.

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=npl-cli&config=ewogICAgImNvbW1hbmQiOiAibnBsIiwKICAgICJhcmdzIjogWyJtY3AiXQp9Cg==)

[Install in VS Code](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22NPL%20CLI%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npl%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22mcp%22%5D%7D)

Simply add `npl-cli` to your MCP configuration file, e.g.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "npl-cli": {
      "name": "NPL CLI",
      "command": "npl",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
