1.  **BACKGROUND**

**NOUMENA Digital AG** a company incorporated in Switzerland, with
registered number 12639845 and registered address Oberdorfsrasse 9,
Baar, CH-6340, Switzerland (**Licensor**, **we** or **us**) has
developed a proprietary language, the NOUMENA Protocol Language (NPL), a
runtime system for this language (NPL Runtime Environment) and
development and devops tools to support the usage of said language and
runtime.

**The User (you, yours)** is licensed the NPL CLI to interact with NOUMENA
runtimes licensed by you. You will also require a license to the NPL Runtime
Environment (see **NPL Runtime Environment** below).\
\
The purpose of the NOUMENA Protocol Language (NPL) is to model
multi-party agreements in terms of the roles and responsibilities
(defined as permissions and obligations), of each of the parties to the
agreement and to clearly define these directly in NPL code.

NPL allows the actions and data, associated with these roles and
responsibilities to be coded and then executed in the NPL Runtime
Environment (see below for more details). The definitions, data and
logic of such agreements are captured in source code as an NPL Protocol,
(which is a formal description of the agreement) NPL itself, the NPL
Runtime Environment , the development and devops tools and how to use
all of these components are fully documented at
[https://documentation.noumenadigital.com](https://documentation.noumenadigital.com).

**NPL-RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT**

You can license the NPL Runtime Environment as a cloud-based PaaS
service (**NPL- RUNTIME PAAS**) or as self-managed on-premise software
usage license (**NPL-RUNTIME ON-PREMISE**). An overview of the current
license models and their terms of use can be found at
[https://noumenadigital.com/product-licenses/](https://noumenadigital.com/product-licenses/). If you have questions
